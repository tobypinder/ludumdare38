LD38 - WorldTD


Design:
  Number of tiny planetoids stand between enemy waves and target planet.

  * Place gun towers on the planets to fight these off.
  * LOS and bullet drop according to planetoids?
  * Must mine resources on the planets
    * Can send resources between planets but takes time.
  * Mining units must be placed for economy.
    * No loot for killing enemies - only time alive.
    * Unless it's drones that must deposit resources on the planets? Could be cool/easy?
  * The planet and moons are divided into distinct segments.
    * If a planet segment hits 0HP - game over.
    * Moon segments can be built upon - they are tower slots.

  * Enemies are "dumb" - direct linear path towards the objective.
    * We could make this look spirally to be cool? The end result is the same except balancing etc.
    * How do we make different/harder enemies feel good? See above, different move patterns? Bullets?

  * How do we convey tower line of sight?
    * Is bullet targeting automatic or is there some nuance eg sharp angle turns result in failure?

##TODO:

  * [X] Selectable Moon segment objects
  * [X] Basic bullet object
  * [X] Basic enemy object
  * [X] Segment Selection UX
  * [ ] Building UX - Towers
  * [ ] Parallax Starfield
  * [ ] Max Perimeter for scrolling.
  * [ ] Scroll using click? - Scrollwheel relative to mouse position
  * [ ] Better moon seeding - make each game different rather than just fixed radius.
  * [ ] Loss condition (segment lost)
  * [ ] Building UX - Basic resources
  * [ ] Enemy Waves and Scaling
  * [ ] Menus/UX
